This database is necessary so that the bot does not lose this information every time it crashes, is restarted, or gets updated.

The bot makes calls to the Steam Web API to get information on Dota 2 updates.

I spent a lot of time brainstorming solutions. At first I tried to keep a count of how many squares were filled in and those groupings and compare them to the number clues, but that ended up being an ugly and confusing solution with too many conditionals. Eventually I decided the best way to determine if a row or column was valid according to the clues would be to use regular expressions, so I reorganized the way I was storing data to be more 'string-friendly' and then created regular expressions for each row and column based on the number clues.

To limit this added difficulty, I increased the ratio of colored squares to blank squares in each puzzle solution. Having more colored squares reduces the ambiguity of the puzzle's number clues as more squares are easily filled in from the beginning.

The bot grabs the id of the person who sent the message as well as their birthday and then makes a post request to an API Gateway with the information gathered as query parameters. Then, the API Gateway triggers a lambda function (written in javascript) that then takes apart the query parameters and sets them up as JSON data to send to an SQS queue. The SQS queue sends this JSON data back to the Spring boot bot application wich listens to the SQS queue and takes the new data and adds it to the database.",Object(z.jsx)("br",{})," ",Object(z.jsx)("br",{}),"Yes, this all couldve been done with just a spring boot app connected to a database. The '!add birthday' flow goes in an entire loop that does nothing except pass information around in different formats. However, the purpose of this bot was not to make an efficient bot, but rather for me to learn some new tools, which I later used in my internship! I also want to clarify that I do understand that this work is uneccessary, and in fact, would be a terrible choice of implementation for something like this. I am aware that there is absolutely no point to using SQS for this as it will never have enough traffic to warrant a message queue and can just call methods as needed. I have the code (about 5 lines) that goes straight past this entire AWS loop and straight to the database in comments."]}),Object(z.jsx)(g.a,{id:"button",as:"a",href:"https://github.com/margueritemb3/dota2pb",target:"_blank",rightIcon:Object(z.jsx)(x.a,{}),colorScheme:"brand",variant:"outline",children:"See Code Repository"}),Object(z.jsx)(p.a,{id:"heading",children:"Road Blocks & Difficulties"}),Object(z.jsxs)(f.a,{id:"text",children:["This bot was not easy, as it was the first Discord bot I had made, and I was also using several other tools and services I had never touched before.

I was trying to learn about Beans, Lambda, the Reactor Core Mono class, and tons of other parts that I had never even heard of.
