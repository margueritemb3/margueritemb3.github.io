I suspect that discord stores nicknames slightly differently, but I need more research and testing to figure out that issue. It might require the use of regular expressions to fix this bug."]}),Object(v.jsx)(j.a,{id:"heading",mt:"50px",color:"brand.500",children:"Potential Extensions"}),Object(v.jsx)(p.a,{id:"text",align:"justify",color:"brand.500",children:"Currently this bot isn't hosted anywhere, so it only runs when it is run on my computer, which isn't practical or useful for the members of the discord that want to use this. I am not sure how much this bot would be used or appreciated if it were available at all times, but I think it would still be cool, and I would still use it. If I wanted to keep it on AWS like everything else, I would figure out how to host the Spring Boot app on Amazon's EC2 and probably use Cloud Formation to manage the AWS resources."})]})]})};var B=Object(d.g)((function(e){var t=e.history,a=e.children;return Object(s.useEffect)((function(){var e=t.listen((function(){window.scrollTo(0,0)}));return function(){e()}}),[]),Object(v.jsx)(s.Fragment,{children:a})})),q=Object(n.a)({colors:{brand:{100:"#1C2736",200:"#394250",300:"#555D69",400:"#8E939B",500:"#FFFFFF",600:"#FED7E2",700:"#FBB6CE",800:"#F687B3",900:"#ED64A6"}},styles:{global:{body:{bg:"brand.100"}}},components:{Button:{variants:{outline:{_hover:{bg:"brand.600",color:"brand.100"},_active:{bg:"brand.100",color:"brand.600",transform:"scale(0.99)"}}}}}});var P=function(){return Object(v.jsx)(h.a,{children:Object(v.jsx)(c.a,{theme:q,children:Object(v.jsx)("div",{children:Object(v.jsx)(B,{children:Object(v.jsxs)(d.c,{children:[Object(v.jsx)(d.a,{path:"/patchbot",children:Object(v.jsx)(S,{})}),Object(v.jsx)(d.a,{path:"/puzzlegame",children:Object(v.jsx)(z,{})}),Object(v.jsx)(d.a,{path:"/birthdaybot",children:Object(v.jsx)(D,{})}),Object(v.jsx)(d.a,{path:"/",children:Object(v.jsx)(k,{})})]})})})})})},W=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&a.e(3).then(a.bind(null,119)).then((function(t){var a=t.getCLS,o=t.getFID,s=t.getFCP,r=t.getLCP,i=t.getTTFB;a(e),o(e),s(e),r(e),i(e)}))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));i.a.render(Object(v.jsxs)(s.StrictMode,{children:[Object(v.jsx)(o.a,{}),Object(v.jsx)(P,{})]}),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)})),W()}},[[97,1,2]]]);
